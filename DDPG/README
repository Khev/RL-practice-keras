NOTES
1. I haven't been able to get the same code working on mac and ubuntu.
2. So for now, I comment out different code blocks in 'actor.py'
3. Must fix this soon.


LOG
1. I believe I have the code working correctly.
2. But solving the enviroment (continuous mountaincar) is hard!
3. I want to solve it before moving on, so that I'm sure my code works.
4. So, I'm doing a hyperparameter search.
5. I should really test the other environments -- like inverted pendulum -- as
well.
6. Or indeed, my clever oscillators :-)
