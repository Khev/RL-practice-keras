    "1. Testing on cartpole\n",
    "2. Note: I've only ever solved cartpole with A2C when I was doing Monte Carlo estimate of the return.\n",
    "3. Here I'm trying to do it with a Q-funtion NN and experience replay\n",
    "4. From doing some quick googling, I see A2C is not usually done with experience replay. Hmm. They usually to MC estiamte of the return, or n-step TD updates.\n",
    "5. This paper combines experience replay with A2C. But he doens't jsut do vanilla experience replay; he does\n",
    "   priorities ER, with some other tricks\n",
    "6. By making by buffer size small, I could crudely approximate this. I'll try that and see what happens. I expect it to be very sample inefficient, so I'll run for large number of episodes\n",
